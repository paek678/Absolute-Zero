# Absolute Zero — Game Design Document

> **Genre**: 2.5D Turn-Based Deathmatch | **Modes**: 1v1 / Multi (3~4) / Solo (vs Bot)
> **Visual**: 3D Korean pavilion (정자) + 2D hand-drawn characters/items
> **Network**: Host-authoritative, Unity Relay (1v1/Multi) / Local (Solo)

> **Scope update — 2026-09-29:** Tarot will not be implemented. Bot starting stats/loadouts and difficulty selection belong to later BT work. Customization uses sprite/atlas replacement without color editing. The finished Closet follows the game-wide refactor. These decisions override older Tarot/color proposals below; current runtime availability is not yet changed by this documentation update. See [PLAN 037](Plans/PLAN_037_gameplay_modular_refactor.md).

## Overview

Players sit across a wooden floor (마루). Each has a **fan blowing cold air**, lowering their body temperature. Use items to attack, defend, or sabotage. **First to reach 0° is frozen.**

```
Starting Temp: 37°  |  Fan: -1°/sec  |  Prep Time: 20s  |  Defeat: 0°  |  Recovery: 1°/sec (after Ready)
```

---

## Game Modes

| Mode | Players | Win Condition | Scene | Death Rule |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|------------|
| **1v1** | 2 (online) | Bo3 — first to 2 round wins | `GameScene` | 0° = round ends |
| **Multi** | 3~4 (online) | First to **5 kills** (cumulative across rounds) | `GameScene_Multi` (NEW) | 0° = ghost, round continues |
| **Solo** | 1 + BT Bot | Same as 1v1 (Bo3) | `GameScene` or `GameScene_Solo` | Same as 1v1 |

### Mode Details

**1v1 (현행 + 개선):**
- Bo3 format, Ready-press order attack, defense always first
- Improvements: 1s prep immunity, 3s animation timing, UI/visual enhancements
- No post-death attacks

**Multi (3~4인 전용):**
- Kill-based scoring (5 kills to win, co-victory possible within one committed action/effect group)
- Death → Ghost state (debuff trolling, ghost kills count as score)
- Round ends when ≤1 player alive (or all dead simultaneously)
- Round reset: all revive at 37°, items/thresholds fully reset, kill score persists
- Click-to-target item selection (click enemy character to designate target)
- Separate balance: Windbreaker 1-use, max 4 random items, threshold grants all 1 each
- Initial random item grant at game start (2 items)

**Solo (1인 + 봇):**
- Same rules as 1v1
- BT AI bot with 2~3 difficulty levels
- No Relay needed, local host execution
- Bot execution: single executable with an internal NGO local host and a server-controlled bot participant (confirmed 2026-09-28; implementation planned in [PLAN_036](Plans/PLAN_036_solo_duel_bt_graph.md))

## Turn Cycle

```
PREP PHASE (20s)          ATTACK PHASE              RESOLUTION
─────────────────    →    ────────────────    →    ──────────────
Fan ON: -1°/sec          Actions execute           Apply results
Select item              in Ready-press order      Check 0° death
Press "Ready"            Defense always active     Threshold items
Fan OFF: recovery        First kill = win          → Next turn
```

### Prep Phase
- Fan decreases temperature at **1°/sec** while active
- **1 item per turn** — select one item, confirm with "사용하기", then press "준비 끝"
  - Exception: certain instant-use items (e.g. Tarot Card) activate immediately on confirm, then allow selecting **1 additional item**
- Alternative: press **"준비 끝"** without selecting any item → no action this turn
- Ready / Main select → fan stops → temperature **recovers at 1°/sec**
- Timer expires with no selection → **idle** (no action taken, fully vulnerable)
- Temperature hits 0° during prep → **instant loss**

### Attack Phase
- Execute in **Ready-press order** (who pressed first goes first)
- **Defense exception**: always activates regardless of order
- If first action kills (0°), **second action is cancelled** — round ends immediately
- Simultaneous Ready → **lower temperature acts first** (comeback opportunity)
- **Multi: mid-turn death** — if a player dies during action resolution, their already-selected action is **cancelled** (not executed)

Camera: Fixed 3rd-person behind player, slight overhead angle
Rendering: 3D background + 2D sprites on floor
Both clients see mirrored view (my items = bottom, opponent = top)
```

### Player Visibility

| Element | Visible | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Opponent character** | Full 2D sprite | Front view, all animations (attack, damage, freeze, idle, etc.) |
| **Self character** | Hand only (TBD) | Full body hidden — first-person hand sprite for item-use animations |
| **Network object** | Both exist | Both Player objects spawned and synced; self player's visual (body/head/hair) is hidden client-side, system logic unchanged |

- System logic (NetworkObject, PlayerState, temperature, combat) runs identically for both players — visibility is purely a client-side rendering concern
- Self player's hand animation asset is not yet created; will be added as a separate sprite/animator later
- During Attack Phase, only the opponent character plays full-body animations (item use, damage reaction, freeze/death)

### Character Architecture

| Layer | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Visual (opponent)** | Scene-placed object | `EnemyPlayer` is pre-placed in GameScene — NOT spawned from prefab. Body, head, hair, arms, animator all included |
| **System logic** | NetworkObject spawn | PlayerState, temperature, combat data — spawned separately as NetworkObject for sync |
| **Linking** | Runtime reference | System logic references the scene-placed visual object; minimal binding (e.g. HP bar repositioning) |

- Character visuals must NOT be instantiated from Player.prefab — use the existing scene object
- Player.prefab is for system logic (NetworkObject + PlayerState) only, not for visual representation
- Visual updates (animations, damage flash, freeze overlay) are driven by the system logic referencing the scene-placed character

---

## Temperature System

```
37° ████████████████████████████ RED        (start)
30° ██████████████████████       PINK       → +1 random item
20° ██████████████               SKY BLUE   → +2 random items, frost edge
10° ████████                     BLUE       → +3 random items, heavy frost
 0° ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ FROZEN     → DEFEAT
```

- Max capacity: **8 random items** (basic items don't count)
- Threshold grants are **one-time only** — re-crossing doesn't re-grant
- Visual: segment markers disappear after grant

## Mini-Game System

Mini-games trigger during PrepPhase when selecting certain items. The PrepPhase timer keeps running.

### Flow

```
Item click → Mini-game starts (PrepPhase timer continues)
  ├─ SUCCESS → item queued for use
  ├─ FAIL    → selection cancelled, return to item selection
  └─ PREP TIME EXPIRES → mini-game force-cancelled, no effect
```

- Failure = immediate selection cancel (one chance only)
- To retry, must re-select the item and play the mini-game again
- Success = item enters the action queue

### Mini-Game Details

| Item | Time | Input | Description | Success | Fail |
|------|------|-------|-------------|---------|------|
| Screwdriver (십자드라이버) | 7s | Circular drag | 3 screws appear. Drag clockwise (3 rotations each) to tighten | All 3 screws tightened in time | Time out or incomplete |
| Claw Machine (집게손) | 7s | Timing tap | Claw moves left-right above target item. Tap when aligned | Claw grabs item at correct timing | Missed timing or time out |
| Water Gun (물총) | 5s | Tap | 3 targets move irregularly. Tap to shoot | Hit all 3 targets in time | Missed targets or time out |
| Hot Pack (핫팩) | 7s | Rapid tap | Hot Pack turns red as tapped, gauge rises. 15 taps to complete | Reach 15 taps in 7s | Count not reached |
| Blue Tape (청테이프) | 5s | Timing tap | Tape stretches with timing bar. Tap in green zone | Tap in green zone | Tap outside green or time out |
| Smartphone (스마트폰) | 5s | Drag | 3×3 dot grid, trace shown pattern (ㄱ, ㄴ, Z, etc.) | Pattern matched | Wrong pattern or time out |
| Buldak Noodles (불닭볶음면) | 10s | Rapid tap | Pot + gauge. Tapping boils water, gauge rises | Gauge reaches 100% | Gauge incomplete |
| Red Card (레드카드) | 5s | Tap | Yellow + red cards appear mixed. Find and tap red card | Tap red card correctly | Tap yellow or time out |
| Hug T-shirt (안아줘요 티셔츠) | 10s | Timing tap (both sides) | Character approaches center. Tap left+right (arms) simultaneously when in hug zone | Timed correctly | Mistimed or time out |

## Environment Variables

Appears at **2nd prep phase** of each round. Random. Resets per round.

| Environment | Effect | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Sunny Day** (햇살쨍쨍) | Fan-off recovery: 2°/sec | Recovery items less valuable |
| **Cool Breeze** (바람선선) | Fan-off recovery: 0°/sec | Recovery items critical |
| **Cicada Song** (매미울음) | Audio/visual distraction | Pure chaos |
| **Kids** (잼민이들) | Steal 1 unused random item | Can't hoard items |
| **Ambulance** (앰뷸런스) | Turn 3: lower-temp player +10° | Comeback mechanic |
| **Summer Vacation** (여름방학) | Prep time: 20s → 10s | Less decision time |
| **Heat Wave** (폭염경보) | Lower-temp player acts first | Overrides Ready-order |

### Environment Variable Staging Detail

> All environment variables follow the same base staging:
> 1. Camera rotates LEFT to show surrounding environment
> 2. Staging text appears center-screen (fade in / fade out) during camera rotation
> 3. Each environment's unique staging plays
> 4. Camera returns to default position

| Env | Staging Text | Background Staging | Sound |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Sunny Day** | "햇살이 더 쨍쨍해집니다." | All Light color → yellow tint, intensity UP | SFX_cicada |
| **Cool Breeze** | "시원한 바람이 불어옵니다." | Wind particle effect appears around scene | SFX_wind |
| **Kids** | "근처에 어린 친구들이 서성거립니다." | Kid sprite rises from below on LEFT side of pavilion | SFX_kidWhistle |
| **Ambulance** | "근처에 응급구조원이 대기중입니다." | Ambulance sprite enters from off-screen LEFT → position (2.47, 1.4, 14) behind pavilion (정자 뒷편) | SFX_siren |
| **Summer Vacation** | "여름방학이 얼마 남지 않았습니다." | Timer shakes on X/Y, clock-inner SpriteRenderer color → RED | SFX_clock |
| **Heat Wave** | "폭염경보가 발생했습니다." | All Light color → red tint, intensity UP | SFX_cicada |

#### Kids — Turn 3 Special Staging
1. Kid sprite on LEFT sinks back down (disappears)
2. Kid sprite rises behind opponent (random item area), animation state: `ready`
3. Animation → `steal`, play SFX_kidSteal, 1 random item consumed from BOTH players
4. Kid sprite sinks down and disappears

#### Ambulance — Turn 3 Special Staging

> Ambulance spawn position: (2.47, 1.4, 14) — z=14 is behind the pavilion (정자 뒷편). After effect triggers, the rescue worker sinks down and is removed.

**If MY temperature is lower:**
1. Full-screen blanket drops from top → covers view (SFX_wear)
2. Temperature recovers, blanket alpha fades to 0

**If OPPONENT temperature is lower:**
1. Rescue worker sprite rises behind opponent (next to opponent)
2. Blanket drops from above → covers opponent (SFX_wear)
3. Rescue worker animation `rescueA_complete` plays simultaneously
4. Opponent temperature recovers, blanket alpha fades to 0
5. Rescue worker sprite sinks down and disappears

---

## Item Selection Flow

```
[1] Click item on floor
        │
  (mini-game required?)
  YES → mini-game starts (PrepPhase timer keeps running)
        ├─ SUCCESS → item queued
        ├─ FAIL    → selection cancelled, back to [1]
        └─ PREP TIME OUT → mini-game cancelled, no effect
  NO  → item queued immediately
        │
  (Sub item?)
  YES → queued, turn continues (can still pick Main)
        → executes at Attack Phase START
  NO  → Main item queued for Attack Phase
        │
[2] Press "준비 끝" → fan OFF, recovery starts → TURN END
    (action cannot be changed after "준비 끝")

Alternative: Press "준비 끝" without selecting → no action this turn
```

> **Main/Sub system:** 1 Main + 1 Sub per turn. Sub items execute at Attack Phase start before Main resolution.
> **TBD:** Which items are Sub? (See Open Questions)

---

## Attack Sequence (Visuals)

```
"납량 시작" (Cooling Begins) → center screen text
     ↓
1st player item animation → temp bar reacts (shake + flash)
     ↓
Check: opponent 0°? → YES: freeze + shatter → round end
                       NO: continue
     ↓
2nd player item animation → temp bar reacts
     ↓
Check: opponent 0°? → round end or next turn
```

### Defeat Animations
| Scenario | Visual |
|----------|--------|
| Opponent reaches 0° | Opponent freezes solid → ice shatters → next round |
| Opponent 0° (final round) | Freeze → character shatters completely |
| Self reaches 0° | Screen edges freeze → fade out → next round |
| Self 0° (final round) | Camera rotates to opponent POV → own character shatters |

### Item Staging Detail

> **Global rules:**
> - Damage/Heal → always play SFX_damaged / SFX_heal + hit/heal visual, in addition to item-specific SFX
> - Item sprite source: (1P) FPS hand sprite, (3P) opponent-use sprite. If no 1P/3P note → use the floor item sprite
> - All item animations play sequentially during Attack Phase (fixed rule — exceptions only when explicitly stated)

## 1v1 Improvements (2026-08 additions)

### System Changes

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Prep Phase 1s immunity** | First 1 second of PrepPhase: fan natural temperature decrease disabled. Item effects and recovery apply normally |
| **3s animation timing** | All item animations unified to 3s total duration (animation + wait) during Attack Phase |
| **Defense always first** | Windbreaker activates before any attack regardless of Ready order (existing behavior reinforced) |
| **Cat reroll timing** | Cat item reroll triggers at cat walk-animation timing, not instantly |

### UI Enhancements

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Lobby UI redesign** | Full visual redesign to casual style matching game concept |
| **Progress HUD** | Top-center: nicknames, crown icon on first-Ready player, active attacker box color highlight |
| **Item selection arrow** | Arrow object above selected item for clear visual feedback |
| **Ready button sprite** | Pressed state changes to "lit" sprite (art asset needed) |
| **Nickname system** | TBD — lobby input / Auth ID / separate account system |

### Visual Enhancements

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Round end cinematic** | 1s fade-out → winner name + score rise animation → 1s fade-in. Final winner: character displayed center |
| **Damage effect upgrade** | Vignette edge effect + camera shake + ice particle burst on hit |
| **Feed animation fix** | Item position aligned to mouth + item sprite matches used item |
| **Eat/drink sprite fix** | Use actual item sprite instead of generic |
| **Defeat animation fix** | Freeze → particle burst → Idle return (next round start via ReviveVisual) |
| **Final defeat particle** | Additional ice shard particle on final round defeat |
| **Hover tuning** | HoverEffect scale/outline parameters increased (no code change, value tuning) |

## Win Conditions

### 1v1 Mode

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Opponent temp = 0° | Win the round |
| Self temp = 0° | Lose the round |
| Both reach 0° simultaneously | Draw — round voided, replay (no score change) |
| First to **2 round wins** | Match victory |

### Multi Mode (3~4)

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Any player reaches 0° | That player enters **Ghost state** — round continues |
| ≤1 player alive (or all dead) | Round ends → all revive at 37° → next round |
| First to **5 kills** (cumulative) | Match victory immediately after the action/effect group that crosses the threshold; remaining queued actions/effects are canceled |
| Multiple players reach 5 kills in the same committed action/effect group | Co-victory |
| Ghost kill via debuff | Counts toward ghost player's kill score |

## Multi-Player System (3~4인 전용)

> Completely separate from 1v1. Different scene, different balance, different win condition.

### Scene Layout (GameScene_Multi)

```
Camera: pos(0,5,-5) rot(22°,0,0) FOV=65 — overhead angle, all 4 seats visible

     SP3(-3,0,6)              SP4(3,0,6)
          ●                      ●

            ┌────────────────┐
            │    정자 마루     │
            └────────────────┘

          ●                      ●
     SP1(-3,0,0)              SP2(3,0,0)
```

- Each client presents its own player at the south/local position.
- The other stable seat identities are projected into west, north, and east visual slots; three-player matches leave one remote slot unused.
- Presentation-slot rotation never changes the authoritative seat index used by NGO state or action targets.
- Each remote seat has `PlayerSeatMarker` + `BoxCollider(trigger)` for click-to-target raycast.

### Balance Differences from 1v1

| Parameter | 1v1 | Multi |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Win condition | Bo3 round wins | 5 kills (cumulative) |
| Max random items | 8 | **4** |
| Initial random grant | None | **2 at game start** |
| 30° threshold | +1 item | **+1 item** |
| 20° threshold | +2 items | **+1 item** |
| 10° threshold | +3 items | **+1 item** |
| Windbreaker | Permanent | **1-use (Consumable)** |
| Tarot Card | Available | **Removed from drop table** |
| Icebox position | Left-center | **South-center, behind the local item row** |
| Death rule | Round ends | Ghost state, round continues |
| Deathmatch grant | N/A | **2 players left → keep current items/uses and fill empty random capacity to 4** |

Deathmatch top-up keeps duplicates in separate slots, allows at most three copies of one item, and never stacks uses into an existing copy.

### Target Selection

- Single-target item use is **click item → aim → snap arrow → click character to confirm**.
- The arrow begins at the selected item, follows the pointer, snaps to a valid character, stays straight for north, and bends strongly toward west/east.
- Before confirmation, re-click the same item, Escape, or right-click cancels locally.
- After confirmation and before Ready, re-clicking the confirmed item sends the server-authoritative cancellation request. Ready locks the choice.
- Self-targeting items (Recovery, Defense, Buff) auto-target self without click

### Round Flow (Multi)

```
ROUND START (all at 37°, items reset, threshold reset)
     ↓
PREP PHASE (20s, 1s immunity)
  - Select item + click-to-target
  - Press Ready → fan off, recovery
     ↓
ATTACK PHASE (minimum 3s per actually played item)
  - Execute in Ready-press order
  - Applicable defense reacts at the incoming attack impact (full block: defense only, partial block: defense + damage)
  - Check the 5-kill threshold after each committed action/effect group
  - On a winner: cancel all remaining actions/effects, finish the deciding presentation, then show the result
  - If player reaches 0° → Ghost state (round continues!)
  - Remaining players keep fighting
     ↓
CHECK: ≤1 alive or all dead?
  YES → Round over, prep text, next round
  NO  → Next turn (PrepPhase again)
     ↓
KILL SCORE: cumulative across rounds
FIRST TO 5 KILLS → MATCH VICTORY
```

---

## Ghost System (다인전 전용)

> Players who reach 0° become ghosts. They can't use items or participate in turns, but can use debuff skills to troll surviving players. Ghost kills count toward score.

### Ghost State Flow

```
Player reaches 0°
  ↓
Freeze animation → ice particle burst → character disappears
  ↓
Current placeholder object marks the ghost (final sprite/appearance TBD)
  ↓
Ghost cannot: use items, press Ready, participate in PrepPhase turn flow
Ghost can: use debuff skills on surviving players during PrepPhase (real-time, free-form)
  ↓
If ghost's debuff causes a kill → last ghost who applied debuff gets the kill score
  ↓
≤1 player alive (or 0) → round ends immediately → all revive at 37°
```

### Ghost Rules (Confirmed)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Action timing** | PrepPhase 중 자유 사용 (real-time, no turn structure) |
| **Target** | Living players only — ghosts cannot target other ghosts |
| **Debuff limit** | 1 debuff active per target (multiple ghosts → only 1 applies) |
| **Kill credit** | Last ghost who applied debuff gets the kill score |
| **Last survivor death** | If ghost debuff kills the last survivor → round ends immediately |
| **Visual** | TBD — keep the current square placeholder until a dedicated sprite is supplied |

### Ghost Debuff Skills

> Values are initial estimates — balance via playtesting.

| Skill | Effect | Cooldown | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Frost Strike** | Target temp instantly −15° | 3 turns | Instant |
| **Chill Aura** | Target fan decrease rate ×2, recovery effectiveness ×0.5 | 2 turns | 1 turn (until next PrepPhase end) |

- Target selection: click on surviving player (same as item targeting)
- Ghost visual: current square placeholder near the seat (final sprite/appearance and movement TBD)
- Skill cooldown prevents infinite debuff spam

### Implemented — Ghost System

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Frost Strike damage | ✅ −15°, CD 3 turns (balance via playtest) |
| Chill Aura | ✅ fan×2, recovery×0.5, CD 2 turns, 1 turn duration |
| Debuff stacking | N/A — debuff limit 1 per target (overwrite) |
| Ghost visual | ⏸ Current square placeholder; final sprite/appearance TBD |
| Ghost skill UI | ✅ 2 skill buttons + click-to-target + cooldown overlay (`GhostSkillPresenter`) |
| Ghost kill attribution | ✅ `TryKill(GhostFrost)` — last debuff applier gets kill credit |
| Cooldown sync | ✅ `GhostCooldownNetData` NetworkList — server-authoritative |

### TBD — Ghost System (플레이테스트 결정)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Ghost movement/positioning on screen | TBD — currently fixed at seat position |
| Frost Strike balance tuning | Playtest — may adjust from 15° |

---

## Post-Death Attack System (다인전 전용)

When a player dies:
1. Existing items are removed
2. Ghost-exclusive **skills** are granted (not items)
3. Skills operate outside the normal turn structure — ghost acts freely while alive players take turns
4. Ghost's PrepPhase/Ready mechanics are completely disabled

---

## Solo Play / Bot AI

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Rules | Same as 1v1 (Bo3) |
| Network | Internal NGO local host; no Relay or UGS login required for Solo (planned) |
| Bot execution | One executable; server-controlled logical bot participant, no separate bot client (confirmed 2026-09-28) |
| Difficulty | 2~3 levels |
| Logic | Shared 1v1 rules and combat; dedicated Solo lifecycle and BT decision adapter (planned) |

### Bot AI Requirements

- BT (Behavior Tree) based decision making
- Must handle: item selection, Ready timing
- **Bot does NOT play mini-games** — applies per-item use penalties such as delay, then follows normal 1v1 item processing; no simulated mini-game score or random success roll. Delay values remain tuning data. Pending use must not bypass Prep expiry or ordinary effect timing.
- Difficulty tuning scope: starting temperature, baseline fan speed, starting items and AI response/temperament; exact values remain to be authored. No approved attack/block/heal multipliers or maximum-temperature changes.
- Visual BT graph and configurable Solo scene implementation plan: [PLAN_036](Plans/PLAN_036_solo_duel_bt_graph.md). Baseline progression, grants and threshold rewards follow existing 1v1. Per-item penalty values and optional custom starting-profile semantics remain to be specified.
- Historical handover: [BOT_HANDOVER](BOT_HANDOVER.md); its old integration snippets are superseded by PLAN_036's identity and perspective contracts.

## Customization System

### Lobby Integration

Lobby screen elements:
- **Solo Play** button
- **Multi Play** button
- **Closet (옷장)** button → opens customization canvas
- **Settings** button
- **Nickname** text input

### Character Customization

5-part equipment system. Reference: Among Us customization UI.

| Part | Sprite Target | Implementation |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Head (머리) | head child | Overlay SpriteRenderer |
| Top (상의) | body child | Sprite swap or overlay |
| Back (등) | body child (behind) | Overlay (sortOrder adjusted) |
| Bottom (하의) | lowerbody child | Sprite swap or overlay |
| Tail (꼬리) | NEW child object | Overlay SpriteRenderer |

### Implementation Approach (Hybrid)

- **Color/tone changes** → Material tint
- **Part additions** (hat, tail, back decoration) → Overlay SpriteRenderer as child of target part
- **Part replacements** (top, bottom variant) → Sprite swap (same pivot/size variant sprites)

### Equipment Logic

- Click to equip/unequip
- Equipping a different item in the same part → auto-unequip previous
- Unlock: currently all available (A), future transition to play-based unlock (B)

### Cosmetic Sync (Multiplayer)

- **Sync timing:** lobby entry — cosmetic data sent when player joins lobby
- **Solo/Bot play:** no multiplayer cosmetic sync (local only)

### Resolved: Mini-Game Judgment Model (Q11)

```
미니게임 중 성공/실패 → 클라이언트에서 판정 → 결과만 ServerRpc로 전송
PrepPhase 타이머 만료 → 서버가 턴 종료 판정 → 클라이언트도 미니게임 강제 실패 처리

핵심: 서버 타이머가 마스터. 클라/서버 핑 차이로 꼬여도
      서버의 "턴 종료" 판정이 최종 → 클라는 무조건 실패로 전환.
```
